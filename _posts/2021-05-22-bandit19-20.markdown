## Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.


## Solution
```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls
bandit20-do
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -la
total 28
drwxr-xr-x  2 root     root     4096 May  7  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 41 root     root     4096 May  7  2020 ..
-rwsr-x---  1 bandit20 bandit19 7296 May  7  2020 bandit20-do
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root      220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root     3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root     root      675 May 15  2017 .profile
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
G------------------------------j
```


## Explanation
This level requires understanding of permissions, especially euid or Effective User ID. The permissons of the bandit20-do file are:
```bash
-rwsr-x---  1 bandit20 bandit19 7296 May  7  2020 bandit20-do
```

The 's' tells us that this file will run with all the permissions of the file owner, bandit20. The 'x' tells us the group bandit19, which we are part of, may read and execute this file. This means we're now able to execute this binary as if we were bandit20. By passing the binary the cat command and the password file for bandit20, we're able to output its contents.
