## Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo. The password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.


## Solution
```bash
bandit29@bandit:~$ cd `mktemp -d`
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.46mxlc2O1J$ git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...

ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:98UL0ZWr85496EtCRkKlo20X3OPnyPSB5tB5RPbhczc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/bandit29/.ssh/known_hosts).

## Explanation
