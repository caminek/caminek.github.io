## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

## Solution
```bash
bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
-file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./*
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07 
k------------------------------h
```

## Explanation
The goal stated that the password was in the only human-readable format. This tells us that the other files would be binary. The quickest way to check all the files is to pass all of the filenames to the **file** command and see what comes back as ASCII.
