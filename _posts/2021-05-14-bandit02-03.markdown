## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory.


## Solution
```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename"
U------------------------------K
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
U------------------------------K
```

## Explanation
Typing **spaces in this filename** without using either quotation marks or escaping the spaces will be interpreted as:

```bash
cat spaces
cat in
cat this
cat filename
```
