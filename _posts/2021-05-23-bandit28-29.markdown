## Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.


## Solution
```bash
bandit28@bandit:~$ cd `mktemp -d`
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.yHAo5UdegH$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...

ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:98UL0ZWr85496EtCRkKlo20X3OPnyPSB5tB5RPbhczc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

## Explanation
This level requires you to know how to view previous commits in order to find the redacted password information. Using git log will show us all of the previous commits and any message that was included. I chose to use diff, but there are several ways we could get the information from this commit. 

Looking at the git logs we can see two interesting messages: "add missing data" and "fix info leak." 

The following line tells git that we want to compare two different hashes. The hash prior to the hash that starts with edd9, and the edd9 hash.

```bash
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.yHAo5UdegH/repo$ git diff edd9~ edd9
```

The shorthand notation isn't required. We could have also entered in the following:

```bash
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.yHAo5UdegH/repo$ git diff c086 edd9
```
