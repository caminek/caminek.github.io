## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution
Right clicking the webpage has been disabled. In Firefox, you can view the source using the following url:
[view-source:http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org/](view-source:http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)

The password is once again in a comment.

```
<body oncontextmenu="javascript:alert('right clicking has been blocked!');return false;">
<h1>natas1</h1>
<div id="content">
You can find the password for the
next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!

<!--The password for natas2 is Z------------------------------i -->
</div>
</body>
```
