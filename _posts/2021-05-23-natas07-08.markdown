## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution
Logging into the site we're asked to enter a secret and have the ability to view the page source.  

Let's look at the source:
```php
<?

$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>
```

Here we see the secret is now encoded as well as a function that encodes out input for later comparison. By performing these steps in reverse, we can decode the encodedSecret. As usual, there are multiple ways to handle this. I've decided to use Python, but this could easily have been done with [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).


```python
import base64

encodedSecret = '3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362'  # encodedSecret taken from web source
secret_decoded = bytes.fromhex(encodedSecret)  # convert encodedSecret from hex to ASCII bytes
b64 = secret_decoded[::-1]  # Reversing secret_decoded gives us valid base64
res = base64.b64decode(b64)  # Decode the base64

print("".join(chr(x) for x in res))  # convert from bytes to str so the output appears cleaner
```

Copy that value returned by the script and paste it into the text field on the natas9 site. Click the button to get the credentials for the next level.
