## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.


## Solution
```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
C------------------------------9
```

## Explanation
If you were to type **cat -** you'd see the terminal scroll one line and do nothing afterwards. Typing any character and pressing Enter would result in the duplication of said  characters. 

The **-** is telling cat to use standard input or output instead of a filename. Prepending **./** tells cat you're looking for a file named - in the current directory.
