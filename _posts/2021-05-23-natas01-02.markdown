## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution
In the page source, we see the following:
```
<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<img src="files/pixel.png">
</div>
```

Here we see there's a directory named files. Let's see if we can browse that directory.
[http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/](http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/)

Here we see users.txt. This file contains the password to the next level.
