## Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.


## Solution
```bash
bandit31@bandit:~$ cd `mktemp -d`
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.dXlwNMYqMt$ git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo

bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.dXlwNMYqMt/repo$ cat README.md 
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.dXlwNMYqMt/repo$ echo "May I come in?" > key.txt
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.dXlwNMYqMt/repo$ git add key.txt 
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:

## Explanation
This level required you to add a file to a git repo and push the changes. Adding the file was a problem due to .gitignore containing *.txt. We could have deleted or edited .gitignore, but I wasn't sure if that would cause a problem later in the level. I opted to force the addition with the -f flag.
