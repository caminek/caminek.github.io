## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution

Logging in we see two link. Let's look at the page source.

```
...
<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
...
```

This site is susceptible to Local File Injection (LFI). Any time you see a URL that appears to include a file from the local server, you should test to see if an LFI exploit would work. In this case the URL http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home seems to include a file named home.  Replace the intended file (home) with one you're looking for. Since the page source told us to look for /etc/natas_webpass/natas8, we'll do exactly that.

The link below will display the password in your browser.

[http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8](http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8)
