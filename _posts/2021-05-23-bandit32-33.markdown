## Level Goal
After all this git stuff its time for another escape. Good luck!


## Solution
```bash
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> ls
sh: 1: LS: not found
>> $0
$ ls
uppershell
$ /bin/bash	
bandit33@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
c------------------------------e
```


## Explanation
This level requires you to know of the special parameter $0. $0 expands to the shell or shell script. This allows us to drop into sh. Bash was not required, but I like having tab-completion.
