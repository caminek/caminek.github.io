## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
~~~
    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size
~~~

## Solution
```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
H------------------------------s
```

## Explanation
As with the previous level, you'll need to know and use find.  

Since the file is located in an unknown directory on the server, we'll need to start our search in the root directory.  This will cause the screen to become filled with "Permission Denied" error messages. We can redirect these unneeded messages, doing so makes it easier to spot a match to our search query.  To do so, append **2>/dev/null** to the find command. This sends STDERR (standard error) to /dev/null where it will be ignored.
