## Level Goal
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new


## Solution
```bash
bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
passwords.new  passwords.old
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new

```


## Explanation
This level requires you to use diff and be able to understand its output. 

The **<** indicates a difference in the first file passed to diff, in this case, passwords.old.  The **>** indicates a difference in the second file passed to diff, in this case, passwords.new.  This tells us that the old password was the one that started with a 'w', and the new password starts with a 'k'.
