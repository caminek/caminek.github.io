## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution
Logging into the site we see an updated version of the previous level. The site states, "For security reasons, we now filter on certain characters." 

Let's look at the source:
```php
Output:
<pre>
<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key)) {
        print "Input contains an illegal character!";
    } else {
        passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
    }
}
?>
</pre>
```

The same trick from the last level works on this level.  Enter **. /etc/natas_webpass/natas11** into the text field and press the button.

## Explanation

Grep stands for Global Regular Expression Parser. The dot in regex stands for any single character, meaning grep matches and then outputs every character in the natas10 password file followed by the dictionary.
