## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution

Logging in we see two link. Let's look at the page source.

```
...
<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
...
```

This site is susceptible to Local File Injection (LFI). Any time you see a URL that appears to include a file from the local server, you should test to see if an LFI exploit would work. In this case, this site's URL seems to include a file named home.  Let's see if we can replace the intended file, home, with one of our choosing. Since the page source told us to look for 
/etc/natas_webpass/natas8, we’ll do exactly that. Delete the word, home, from the end of the URL and enter /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 in its place.

The credentials for the next level will appear in the browser.
