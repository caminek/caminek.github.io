## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.

## Solution
```bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
The password is 5------------------------------u
```

## Explanation
This level requires you to know what ROT13 and how to decode it. There are numerous utilities and websites to decode this. Here I chose to use tr as I'd expect to have that available on a target machine.
