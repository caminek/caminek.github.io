## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

## Solution
```bash
bandit9@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep =
========== the*2i"4
=:G e
========== password
<I=zsGi
Z)========== is
A=|t&E
Zdb=
c^ LAh=3G
*SF=s
&========== t------------------------------k
S=A.H&^
```

## Explanation
While the file is named data.txt, it is not an ASCII file. **cat data.txt** outputs garbage to the screen. Using the strings command will allow us to see ASCII strings within a binary. To limit the output, we search for output that contains **=**.
