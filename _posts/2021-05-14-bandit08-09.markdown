## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once.

## Solution
```bash
bandit8@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit8@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
U------------------------------R
```

## Explanation
This level requires knowledge of sort, uniq, and pipes. The sort command is self-explanitory. The uniq command requires -u in order to output only unique lines. Other options, such as -c will provide a count for each occurrance of a match.
