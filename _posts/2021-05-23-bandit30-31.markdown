## Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo. The password for the user bandit30-git is the same as for the user bandit30.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.


## Solution
```bash
bandit30@bandit:~$ cd `mktemp -d`
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.hVntDJaFrf$ git clone ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...

ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:98UL0ZWr85496EtCRkKlo20X3OPnyPSB5tB5RPbhczc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/bandit30/.ssh/known_hosts).
