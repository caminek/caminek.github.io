## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution

Logging in we're now prompted for a secret and have an option to view source code.  Let's examine the source code.

```php
<?
include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>
```

Here we see the value within includes/secret.inc is compared to our input. Let's see if we can open that file.

[http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc](http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc) appears to be blank, but if we view the page source, we'll see the secret. Enter that value into the text field and press Submit Query.
