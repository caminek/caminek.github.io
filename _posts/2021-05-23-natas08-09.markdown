## Level Goal
Excluding the URL and username, the Level Goal section is blank for the Natas ctf.


## Solution
Logging into the site we're asked to enter a secret and have the ability to view the page source.  

Let's look at the source:
```php
<?

$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>
```

Here we see the secret is now encoded as well as a function that encodes out input for later comparison. By performing these steps in reverse, we can decode the encodedSecret. As usual, there are multiple ways to handle this. I chose to use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

Step 1: We need to convert encodedSecret from hex
Step 2: We need to reverse the results of Step 1
Step 3: We need to base64 decode the answer

Paste the value assigned to encodedSecret into the Input section of CyberChef

In CyberChef use the following recipes, leaving their defaults set:
1: From Hex
2: Reverse
3: From Base64

The decoded secret will appear in the output section. Copy that value and paste in into the text field on the natas9 site and click the button.
